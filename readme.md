# mnemnion erogdox ez glow firmare


This is my QMK firmare set, focused around a smooth developer experience for macOS.


## Features

- Two command keys next to the thumb cluster
- Two tab keys next to space and return on the thumb cluster
    + This combination allows app switching with both hands
- Third command key under the x key
    + This makes it easier to cut, copy, paste, and undo
- One-shot left shift key, for fluid capitalization
    + Also featuring a three-press toggle lock
- Left and right window switch sequences in the upper corners
- Alt and control on the top of the thumb cluster
    + Single-press left alt sends escape
- (Currently) left layer key is a deadkey while I get out of the
  habit of pressing y with my left finger
- "' and \\| have switched places since I type the former a great
  deal more than the latter and this puts them in the same place as
  on a normal keyboard. It's the one baffling decision that ergodox
  EZ default makes imho
